## Project Overview

This repository contains an implementation of machine and deep learning techniques for segmenting and classifying brain tumors on T1-weighted MRI images. Brain tumor detection in its early stages is crucial for patient treatment and survival. This project uses computational intelligence-oriented techniques to help identify and classify brain tumors from MRI scans.

## Features

- **Data Processing**: Preprocessing of T1-weighted MRI images
- **Segmentation**: Advanced segmentation techniques to isolate tumor regions
- **Classification**: Multi-class classification of brain tumors using both machine learning and deep learning approaches
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive evaluation metrics to assess model performance

## Dataset

The project works with T1-weighted MRI brain scan images. These images are commonly used for brain tumor detection and provide good contrast for differentiating between healthy and tumor tissues. 

> Note: The specific dataset used in this project is detailed in the Jupyter notebook.

## Models Implemented

### Machine Learning Techniques
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Other traditional machine learning classifiers

### Deep Learning Approaches
